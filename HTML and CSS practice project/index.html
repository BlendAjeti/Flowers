                    <h3>Titan Arum</h3>
                    <p>It's not unfortunate that the Titan Arum, also known as the infamous "corpse flower," only blooms for a few days of the year, considering that it reeks of rotting flesh when it finally blossoms. Opening at night, the flower's scent attracts carcass-eating insects, which pollinate its central spike, or inflorescence, until it collapses three days later.

                        One of the largest flowers in the world, the Titan Arum can grow 20 feet (6 meters) tall and 15 feet (4.5 meters) across in the wild. While the corpse flower can be found in many botanical gardens, including the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, in nature it only grows in the tropical forests of Sumatra in Indonesia.
                        
                        The inflorescence of the corpse flower is actually composed of thousands of miniscule flowers, which heat up during the blooming process, triggering the release of the awful odor, which is caused by sulfur-based compounds. Thankfully, while the flower blooms for three days, the smell typically only lasts for about eight hours.</p>
